# Server Needed
- The site is going to use the Firebase server to host and deploy the site. 
# Where to put File/Folder
- The folder is going to be at the top of all the Henry-Gets-Moving files so any firebase files can be put into the foler.
# Start/Stop System
- In order to start the system, you have to run `firebase init hosting`. In order to deploy it `firebase deploy --only hosting` needs to be run. In order to update the site `npm run build` and then `firebase deploy` are run.
# Trouble Shooting
- If something goes wrong then check to see if the build has been ran or if it has been deployed. 
# Source of Errors
- Where to find errors could be going to the console or terminal and seeing where the errors are happening.
# Critical Pieces
- The most vulnerable piece could be any of the forms or areas that store data.
