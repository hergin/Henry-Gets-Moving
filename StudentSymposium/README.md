# Paragraphs About Experiences

## Melody

> I feel I knew what to expect this year, given I did the symposium last year. And it was essentially identical to what I expected — judges not caring about the CS department, and voting biology projects with incomprehensible, long titles and boring posters as the winners. I went into the symposium with the intent to win — nothing else. Understandably, I left a bit upset. The time I put into standing there for hours and explaining my year's work to a bunch of people that whole time was essentially for nothing, since I wasn't getting paid for it like I was last year. Overall, my "experience" at the symposium just felt _bad_, but I expect that, at this point, from this class. It was par for the course, at this rate. I imagine it'll be better experience presenting at SEKE2023 in California come July than this was.

> I had never been to a student symposium before so I thought that it was kinda cool. When I set up I went with other people from capstone so it was easy to find where everything was and where everyone else was set up. During that time I was able to walk around and see other peoples' boards and some people had presentation topics that I thought were really interesting and I wish I could have been there to see the presentation about it. I only was able to see the boards becuase I was only able to stay for the beginning before I had to leave because I had work.
