## Things Clarified
- this section genuinely makes no sense to me and i have no idea what's supposed to go here that _isn't_ supposed to go in "things discussed". what is a thing clarified that is not a thing discussed. they are all things that are discussed. this makes no sense and it has not made any sense since the beginning of last semester
