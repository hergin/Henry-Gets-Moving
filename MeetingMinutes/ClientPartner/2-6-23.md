## Client use of the project
- Played the games based on the answers we came up with
- spelled broccoli wrong
- tried to click and drag for the word search, but we have it set to click because ipad touch would be easier
- tried to find the things in the word search. literally had to play our game and said it was fun. good job to us tbh
- looked over the about page, nitpicked wording and edited to her liking to make it focus more positive
