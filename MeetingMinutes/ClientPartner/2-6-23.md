## Topics Discussed
- Showed off site on an iPad since that's the primary intended use case
	- In the future
		- Will show Exercise of the Day, Recipe of the Day
	- Register user with email
	- Buttons that need registration either are disabled or re-route to `/login`
	- After logging in comes back to main page
	- If logged in, shows squirm in place of login button
	- Logging exercise, add all the information 
	- Clicking on individual exercises brings up popup box with the youtube link and the name and stuff
	- Recipe page has cook time, ingredients, steps, etc
	- About page has pages from facebook and youtube / facebook links
	- `LearnMore.tsx`
		- In order to have a hover drop-down will be difficult because it will be on mobile, thus had to push to next iteration, but is set up and has a dialogue box
	- Admin panel
		- Semi-functional
		- For client to input new fields, like exercises and recipes, switch the 'of the day' ones, can select a specific one and it'll pre-fill all the fields to edit said specific exercise
		- Once you hit save exercise, will refresh whole page to clear out fields
- Client thinks it looks great
- Feels like we made lots of progress
- Updates from client:
	- Went to the school the past couple fridays
	- Next wednesday the author will be here at ball state to talk to the client's classes
		- Invited us to come in
	- He may have some tips and advice, since he used to have a website in the past (teamhenry.org, henrygetsmoving.com)
	- Can do whatever we want with the URLs and using pictures from the book
	- New students' goal is to provide us with the information we'd put in the backend, like recipes, exercises, all the attributes of them:
		- Exercises
			- Thumbnail image
			- Name
			- List of categories that exercises would fall under
				- Unsure about how to split it up
				- Ultimately up to client
				- Aerobic, Cardio, Strength, etc
			- Video link (YouTube) (Need `embed` link)
		- Recipes
			- Name
			- Ingredients
			- Cook Steps
			- Image thumbnail
			- Category/ies
			- Cook time
		- Diagrams / Demonstrations
			- How will they be provided?
				- Images
			- How many will there be?
				- Will we need a view more button?
			- Have 'infographics' that would be more specialized to kids
				- If an infographic was made and sent to us, we could just put it in the website with the text
				- as a PNG file
			- Currently just plays video - this is "okay for now"
				- Also need thumbnail images
				- Can be gotten from YouTube's auto-generated thumbnails for videos
- Figma is currently being updated
- About page might have updated images and could add some videos to the page
	- Image isn't super recent
	- Video would be very specific to what is being done at Burris
		- "Henry Gets Moving at Ball State"
		- How should videos be displayed?
			- Probably at the bottom, below the links?
			- Will send after gets approval from everyone involved in the videos
- Money side
	- Coördinators trying to figure out who is going to handle the money
	- We can go to client whenever we're ready to deploy and things that need money involved

## Things Clarified
- Thinking about deployment, so client can view it without having to talk to us
	- Had it set up previously so that for videos and thumbnails could upload files, but had to change it due to lack of a cloud service
		- Two options: OneDrive, AWS, _maybe_ Google Drive
	- To have the ability to upload files directly, would need cloud service, but can also just keep using links
	- If used OneDrive, we would need access to the OneDrive API
	- Ball State has both AWS and OneDrive, but we would need permission from BSU to use them
		- They're probably finnicky
	- Thus, links are probably easier
	- If client wanted to move away from links and instead upload files directly, could ask for permission to use
	- Could use OneDrive API - it's an option, but there's no rush because YouTube links work fine
		- Might take this route in the future for simplicity's sake

- Plans for next iteration
	- Calendar page to view all logs
	- Filling up the trophy
	- Filters
	- Search
	- See more
	- Cosmetic things
	- Probably re-make entire backend, thus can add extra categories ↓ probably

- Still up in the air
	- Game page
		- Will probably have to be its own iteration to itself because of how in-depth it is
		- We want to give it our all

- Recipe categories
	- Breakfast / lunch / dinner vs vegan / nut free / gluten free

- Client will update if hears anything from author
- URL
	- team-henry.org vs henrygetsmoving.com
	- Someone seems to have already bought team-henry.org
	- teamhenry.org is purchased but not in use
	- Client will ask

- Is it better to make it more specific to Delaware County, or more generic?
	- Question to ask: does client want people to know about only the client's work, or everyone who is doing it?

- Still need
	- about page content
	- Client can make new youtube channel for HGM delaware county, and we can change the button on the about page to link to that, assuming that's where the exercise videos will be uploaded
