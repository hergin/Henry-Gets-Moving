## Topics Discussed
- What we got done
	- Clicking the henry png opens book
	- can feature recipes and exercises
	- trophy fills up depending on how much exercise you have logged per child with a selector for them
	- the games!!!!
	- the crossword
	- we didn't get the answers, so we came up with what we thought they were
- idea of putting in a bingo thing, but probably just something you can download and print because of how it works
- needing things to put in for deployment
	- told about all the parameters we need for recipes and exercises, plus demos and diagrams
	- could just get a regular youtube link and regex it into an embed link
- haven't touched the about page in a while, is it still good?
	- image is good
	- wanted to take out the line about henry being teased
	- make the about page more positive, hey jasmine is a great friend
	- focusing on the moderation
	- more positive
	- instead of young boy, call him a hamster
	- allowed client to edit the code to make it how she wanted it
- client looked for youtube channel that apparently already exists where they might upload the exercise videos
- will make a channel for the videos
- no way to delete categories, we will add one
- explained parameters needed to add and delete things on the admin panel
- docs cool
- doing next iteration
	- indication of 60 minutes for calendar page
	- multiple categories for one exercise
	- adding games to download
	- animations (keyframes)
## Things Clarified
- Showed off entire website to andrea
	- person who is also working on the project
	- nicole wanted us to show it off to her
	- showed off like  the WHOLE website. logging exercise, calendar, exercises list, recipes, etc
	- recipes show cook time and stuff
	- can search and filter by categories
- next iteration hoping to show indicators of where the exercise happened
- client asked about when we need the money
	- probably not until iteration 5
- decided on url as `henrygetsmoving.org` for 10 bux first month and 21$ after that
- client asked; would more games be good?
	- maybe games we can download and print out
- some of the images we got were copyright things, but if we pull thumbnails from the youtube api then it's gucci maybe
- this should be good for resumes if we can keep track of it
## Client use of the project
- Played the games based on the answers we came up with
- spelled broccoli wrong
- tried to click and drag for the word search, but we have it set to click because ipad touch would be easier
- tried to find the things in the word search. literally had to play our game and said it was fun. good job to us tbh
- looked over the about page, nitpicked wording and edited to her liking to make it focus more positive 
	- made a few edits and pushed to main bc it was a pretty small edit
- seemed to go pretty smoothly besides a few little nitpicks
- added a space between `Word` and `Search`
- was anything hard to understand if we didn't explain it? site flow, usage of the site?
- submitted a recipe and it says exercise submitted, whoops
	- edited that
- used the admin panel, submitted an exercise log, viewed added exercises, recipes, demonstrations, diagrams
- 20 minutes ish
- general reaction: good, easy to use
- if user doesn't enter a link, the video shows an embed of the entire website somehow???
- going to the page with the trophy on it broke if you don't have any children
- can enter letters in duration box
- "simple but fun looking, easy to use"
- registered, made an account, logged in, logged exercise, viewed on calendar and looked at trophy
