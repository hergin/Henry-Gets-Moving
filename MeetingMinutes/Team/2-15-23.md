â†‘ Contain this image of him
He is rude

## Topics Discussed
- no one has really done anything since the iteration started
- how to handle if a child has a typo in their name?
- probably set it up so that deleting all a child's logs means they nolonger exist
- would change the migrations in the backend--on deletion of a family member,also deletes all their logs
- indicator on the calendar page--do we know how to access individual days on the calendar component?
- front-end testing may be an issue with jest's `maxWorkers`, but can't get that to work in `package.json` without `eject`ing, so will have to figure that out
- since the calendar thing depends on CSS, making an icon on it Might be impossible, and if not, use a color
- during meeting set up main branch protection on github on front-end and back-end repositories
- probably want to try to do the symposium, have to register before march
- we have a good chance
## Things Clarified
- do the assets for the log indicators exist?
- mars made them
- for calendar indicators, if have to use colors, use gold for 60 mins, and green for any
- could maybe use background image width
  - some of it might be cut off or squished, distorted
- can't really add a border around text either
- how to truly modularize the backend in the way the prof wants?
  - looked at the adonis docs and can't exactly find anything about how to make a "data layer"
  - this is kinda just how restful apis are
