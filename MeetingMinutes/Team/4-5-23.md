## Topics Discussed
- **delete categories**
	- can't quite figure out how to get the correct variable for the type of category they want to delete to display in the drop-down menu, since the deleteCategoryType is just a string--tried using `eval()` to write code as an interpolated string since the string corresponds very closely to the variable names anyway, but that didn't work out--and using if statements doesn't seem to work in the curly braces in a react element like i would want it to
	- maybe have an if statement in the first dropdown that assigns something?
	- maybe have deleteCatgeoryTYpe && categories && map. and hust have 3 of them so only the ones that are valid would show up
- **front-end testing**
	- worked on the new create-react-app, and all i did was copy and paste a test and the minimum code to get it to run onto the new app and didn't even change any configuration, it just worked, so i have no idea what the issue could possibly be, since the code was identical. probably just a fluke or something
	- still working on it, but it's making it hard to keep track of both the two tasks i was distributed And the testing at the same time
- **poster**
	- it's yellow now
	- worked on it during the meeting
- talked about schedule for student symposium
- melody probably gonna be the only one there for most of it
## Things Clarified
- i RSVP'd for the spring thing in person so there's no email, but i submitted it and it was graded in class so we're gucci on that
## Tasks Distributed
same as last week
