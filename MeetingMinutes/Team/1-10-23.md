## Topics Discussed
- New section added to minutes requirements for team meetings
- Guess we'll have to do that now
- A bunch of maybe easier stuff and then the games, which is considerably harder
- Opening a new tab on clicking a link: target blank
- Definitely just letting the browser's native pdf reader do the book
- If time allows, could add a small pop up dialog box letting user know that the book cover is clickable
- How to do an on-hover on iPad?
- if something pushed breaks, please communicate instead of just deleting it
- and use git flow
## Things Clarified
- Getting featured stuff on the admin panel to work is possibly harder, but getting it to pull on the homepage is different, so we could split it up like that
- Home page is as simple as just changing the div bc we already have a method to pull from the database
- To be able to update the admin panel functionality, have to send two requests to set one to false and one to true
- Nicole sent us a crossword and a word search, which would be easi*er* than a maze
 - for the maze, wants squirm, but don't know how to add our own assets
- likely will end up going to prof's office hours regarding ETIMEDOUT on the database transactions on the backend for testing which has existed for like 3 iterations
- CSS properties can maybe define what happens when it's touched when scrolling
- attempted default values for the .env.test on the backend to see if that fixes ETIMEDOUT (it didn't)
## Tasks Distributed
### Kiri
- Crossword
- Trophy
- admin panel categories styling
### Mars
- Word search
- admin panel featured
- modularize backend
### Melody
- home page database connection (recipes, exercises)
- admin panel categories functionality
- home page pdf of book
- unit tests (front and back) (the hard part) (in my opinion) (at least to me)
