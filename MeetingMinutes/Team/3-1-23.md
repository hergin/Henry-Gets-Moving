## Topics Discussed
- carousel works, kiri just needs to add the games
- mars: kinda got sidetracked, 'cause when the software grade came out they tried to look for a way to modularize it that fits within the bounds of adonis, and having issues finding a way to do it that works in adonis
- trying to figure out a thing with the logs on the calendar page, can't unpack the promises
- frontend testing with jest is still broken because every method i've tried to configure it within the realm of react scripts with create react app doesn't seem to let me access the fields it seems like i'll need in order to get them to work correctly based on all the things i'm finding on the internet
- integration tests also would need to go through jest since the backend is more independent and the frontend calls the backend, but that would be async which seems to break jest for now
- can't find a way to change the configurations of jest in a way we'd need to that doesn't involve changing our whole test configuration, essentially rendering all the tests we have useless
- no one ever responded to the chair. our schedules don't overlap very much
- probably ask for wednesday from 1 to 3
## Things Clarified
- on the exam, may have been open-note bc got one question wrong bc the auto grader expected exact wording, and i worded it slightly differently
- the one about rules and subrules. i only remembered the exact wording for the rule :(
- should probably email nicole abt setting up the email thing before break so we're not rushing
