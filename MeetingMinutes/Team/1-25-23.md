## Topics Discussed
- not a lot done this week
- a lot of branches currently in progress with things almost done
- backend side of the admin panel featured is finished, but it hasn't been integrated into the front-end
- cleaning up the backend has been a bit rough since it's been a while since we heard the criticisms about it
- games haven't gotten a ton done 'cause it's hard
- kiri fixing the images being super big for the featured exercises and recipes
- nicole sent multiple word searches--how do we handle setting those up with the games page?
  - should there be multiple versions of it? should it refresh somehow
  - "i'll figure it out. worst case, there's only one"
- finished up home-page images fixing, pull request merged
- possible next iteration feature: keyframe animations
- feature 2: a notification that the book on the home page is clickable
- deployment.md & development.md needs updates based on what we got slammed about
## Things Clarified
- the way we were gonna do featured admin panel has been changed -- calling it from the backend instead of from the front-end, so some new stuff has to be done
- currently looking for a codepin to help out with making the word search
- viewing featured recipes and exercises requires adding exercises and recipes with `featured` set to `1`
- needed updates to documentation:
  - user.md needs new features added
  - development.md needs....... node or something??
  - deployment.md idk
