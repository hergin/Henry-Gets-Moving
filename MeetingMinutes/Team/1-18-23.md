## Topics Discussed
- The trophy
  - Kiri: working on it
  - It currently doesn't show up if you're not logged in
  - If you log exercise with a child's name, it displays their name
- Mars: trying to get featured stuff on the admin panel to work, but hasn't pushed anything bc it's not working
- Melody: of-the-day stuff is finished, on the home-page branch which is admittedly poorly-named
- Testing: still borked, sent out a message
- Of-the-day stuff: finished implementing, but currently has an issue where the image sizes aren't being limited
- **The Game**
  - How to switch between games?
  - Various solutions, such as having them all loaded but changing the display?
  - Switching to different pages depending on which is clicked?
  - Carousel not needed, since there will probably only be three
## Things Clarified
- Trophy
  - Trying to get it to work with time duration, but it's hard to get total log duration
  - Melody will implement a method in the API to do it
- Kiri pushed styling for admin-categories to main
- Admin categories doing two fetch requests is difficult, so may have to take a different route to setting a new featured recipe/exercise
- We know and understand the issues with testing, but we've done a lot of research and still don't know how to find the solution
- Kiri knows how to fix the big images
- Biggest things we're focusing on are the games and the testing - these are the things we can't really do last-minute
- did anything change about mentor meetings since team meetings changed?
  - will ask tomorrow
