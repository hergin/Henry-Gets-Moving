## Topics Discussed
- youtube-embed branch has more changes on it after it was merged
  - some things were cleaned up
    - now supports youtu,be and links with playlists in them
    - also effectively removes share links as well, i think
    - unit tests were added & they pass (visible if run individually `npm test API`)
- frontend testing still has the issue with the child process exceptions
- backend testing is still good though
- games carousel will be a set number of games. trying to do three per page but the slice isn't working
- mars started looking into the youtube-api stuff, but you need a google account to attach it to and a payment plan set up Just In Case you go over the limit
  - limit shouldn't be a problem, but you do need that google account thing, and mars doesn't want to put it on their personal gmail account
  - since they're making a youtube channel for their demos, we can probably have it on that account
- kiri merged animations, they're really good
- some of the games that they gave us used photos that said shutterstock on them. watermarked. copyrighted
- but it should be fine. the client isn't making any money off this website, so the copyright should fall under fair use or whatever
- but even then, it's kinda their problem
- multiple categories not really that hard, "as far as I'm concerned, I think it's just creating a new table that includes rows & rows of â€¦ instances of a categroy being attached to a exercise/demo/recipe"
- current error messages are not very good
- could be a good feature for next iteration
- some of the links were too long when i tried to put them in this morning
- nicole will likely have this same issue
- prolly would be a good thing for next iteration
- signed up for the symposium during meeting
## Things Clarified
- kiri working on putting downloadable games into a carousel
- set number of games
- thing in a react form that lets you select multiple
  - checkboxes
- should be an npm library that has a dropdown where you can pick multiple
