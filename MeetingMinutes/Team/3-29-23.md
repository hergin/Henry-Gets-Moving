## Topics Discussed
- no one's really gotten anything done since last meeting
- but i went to ergin's office hours
- gave updates on what i learned and the current frontend testing roadmap
- end of the day we'll graduate and we can't get failed bc frontend testing isn't that much of the grade
	- tried making a new create-react-app project and had a whole slew of Other issues, to the point where that might not even be worth it considering it would take work to set that up just to see if it has the same issue, and then we wouldn't even be testing the same thing
	- wrapping asynchronous code in a synchronous method doesn't seem to work either, bc typescript doesn't play nice with trying to extract primitive values out of promises
- backend testing is still good, have good coverage. only thing we have to edit the backend for this iteration is to edit logs and maybe the password for the admin panel
- still have yet to distribute tasks this iteration, but we have an odd number. probably gonna need multiple people working on one thing
- probably have multiple people working on editing exercise logs
- started on poster for april 7th by making slides presentation
- talked about unrelated things. general graduation timeline
- deployment timeline, since nicole is kinda clueless on that
## Things Clarified
- frontend testing isn't a huge part of our grade, so we're not Too worried about it. if worse comes to worst, we can work on it, and maybe it'll make my PCW specifically look good if i can't do anything else bc i'm too busy working on frontend testing
- family member manager would be with the dropdown on the calendar page, so with that family member selected you can like edit their name or delete them and if you delete them you delete all their logs
