## Topics Discussed
- if iterations are only a month, it's gonna end a month before the semester ends
	- you do like a presentation and make a poster board
	- might also present in front of a bunch of faculty who come and check it out
	- great bc you're not worrying about this and also finals
	- "handing it off to your client"
	- there's still a final in this class but it's mostly just the project
- showed off kiri's crossword
	- it's very cool
	- "yeah, that's neat"
	- has its own tablet view
	- mentor says it's nice to be thinking about it
- also got trophy done
	- based off total duration of whatever family member you select and will display the appropriate trophy
	- "very cool"
- testing (explosion emoji)
	- problems with both the backend and the frontend
- documentation looks great
	- not quite done
- this iteration can be rough, but it's kind of a refresh iteration to tighten everything up
- "i hope everything goes AOK, you guys got this, you're gonna crush it to the best of your ability, and if you don't there's always next iteration"
## Things Clarified
- pushing to main okay just for one small change?
	- probably be fine, says mentor
- mentor asked if we're interested in concentrations
	- melody doing cybersecurity
	- annie was curious
- plans after graduation?
	- annie didn't really have any plans
	- applied to one place and got the job
	- "problem solved, i guess"
	- "i'm maybe not the best for career advice"
	- if interested in UI/UX design and living in fort wayne indiana, can recommend working at sweetwater
	- talked about what sweetwater is
	- they hire more on personality than on what you know, so if you don't know a lot, you'll probably still be fine
	- it's okay if you don't know what you're gonna do, "cause i didn't and it worked out"
