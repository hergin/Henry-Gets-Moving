## Topics Discussed
- frontend testing is strange bc it's been messed up for a few iterations
- and we still can't figure it out
- maybe the strategy is to present all the thing we have tried to prove it's not like we didn't try

  - games carousel
  - pivoted on the styling for the calendar to a delete button for logs
  - animations
  - multiple categories for items in database

  - "a hard feature to show, but it's nice"
  - quality of life..............

  - for me, frontend testing and the thing i couldn't figure out
  - for kiri, getting back into the swing after spring break
  - for mars, not written a single line of code this iteration
    - senioritis
  - Low MotivationÂ©
  - maybe find a thing we want to do and only allow ourselves to do it once we're done working on this project if motivation is an issue
  - mentor's group did a thing where they had a discord, and anytime someone was working on the project they would sit in a voice channel
