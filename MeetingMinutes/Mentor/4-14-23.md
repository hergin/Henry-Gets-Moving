## Topics Discussed
- the last mentor meeting
  - i think?
- are we excited to be done working on this
  - absolutely
- stuff we got done (or are working on)
  - family member manager
    - styled
    - almost works aside from backend
  - edit logs
    - looks very cool
  - delete categories
    - like to have control over every little thing
    - “just deleting something is always more difficult than it sounds”
- do we feel good about what we’ve done, is there more we wish we’d done
  - if it were my own personal project and i wasn’t bound by the constraints of deadlines and being graded, i would’ve done more error handling and QoL changes
- are we gonna deploy it with nicole?
  - she doesn’t know how, so we have to do it on our own
  - not sure about what to do about the money with the domain
  - most other groups are gonna handoff to clients that do know how to deploy
  - ours doesn't
  - a cool thing to do, but not necessarily graded
- kiri bathed her cat
## Things Clarified
- how deploying is gonna work
  - don’t they already have a site?
    - don’t think so
