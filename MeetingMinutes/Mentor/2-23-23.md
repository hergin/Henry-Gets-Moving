## Topics Discussed
- not a lot to really talk about. most of our features for this iteration are kinda invisible
- there are animations, putting carousel of games on the games page
- youtube-embed with regex to convert links of all youtube kinds into embed
- what features do we want to work on?
  - downloadable printable paper games
  - multiple categories for exercises/demos/recipes based on client feedback
  - youtube api to get video thumbnails so that nicole doesn't have to provide a thumbnail link
    - don't really have to fix that unless youtube api returns really long links
- feedback from the iteration presentation
- even in mentor's job, people still push directly to main/dev branch
- thinks it's fine we were still doing branches even if we misunderstood the setting on github
- talked about. professors. random bonding activities
- docs good. as usual
- working in tech as a woman, mentor has found that out in the world people are pretty nice and cool
- it's not always as bad as it is in college
- advice for this iteration: try to just do a fresh reset of our minds, ideas; don't let the past drag us down. Keep Moving Forward¡¡¡1
## Things Clarified
