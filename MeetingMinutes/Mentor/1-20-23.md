## Topics Discussed
- Sucks cominhg back after winter break sucks
- Melody's gotten stuff done, but the games page has been a bit rough
  - It's basically a whole project in itself
- Implemented features:
  - OTD: Exercise, Recipe, homepage, recipes page, exercise page, get total durations of exercise logs method
- Testing is still borked
  - Reasons for testing being borked
- Things working differently on different machines
- Mars mostly working on cleaning up the backend because we got slammed for it last iteration
  - Modularizing it, "single responsibility principle"
- Mars and Kiri splitting up games
- Annie thinks this is a good time to clean up code because it's the beginning of the year
  - Good to try to perfect the things that we do have rather than trying to add a bunch of things
  - "This is the iteration to clean up your code and make sure it's understandable" since you haven't looked at it in a while
  - Try not to leave loose ends untied
  - First semester there's a lot of ideas and things to implement, since we have to get something functional in like a month
  - "Try not to give yourself a lot of things you feel like you _need_ to finish ... [and leave] a lot of plotholes left to fix"
- Documentation looks good, no real critiques, need to update `User.md` maybe
- Mid-iteration is always a bit "some"-ish, and then the last check-in before the client meeting is like A Lot
## Things Clarified
- Beginning of the semester is a little hard to get shit done anyway
- Backend testing is still kind of an enigma
- Every page on the Jest testing is probably purple
  - It's still a little borked since all the methods I've tried don't really exist anymore
  - Async methods were executing _after_ the assertions and it took a while to even find that out
  - Talking about all this stuff earlier on in the semester was probably a good thing
- What do we want to get done for this iteration?
  - Games
  - Putting a bunch of effort into getting the tests fixed
  - A few little features, like the stuff Melody did
